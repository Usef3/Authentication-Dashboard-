    Originally released under LGPL.  Graciously donated to PIL in
    March 2009, for distribution under the standard PIL license

    The pyCMS.py module provides a "clean" interface between Python/PIL and
    pyCMSdll, taking care of some of the more complex handling of the direct
    pyCMSdll functions, as well as error-checking and making sure that all
    relevant data is kept together.

    While it is possible to call pyCMSdll functions directly, it's not highly
    recommended.

    Version History:

        1.0.0 pil       Oct 2013 Port to LCMS 2.

        0.1.0 pil mod   March 10, 2009

                        Renamed display Profile to proof Profile. The proof
                        Profile is the Profile of the device that is being
                        simulated, not the Profile of the device which is
                        actually used to display/print the final simulation
                        (that'd be the output Profile) - also see LCMSAPI.txt
                        input colorspace -> using 'renderingIntent' -> proof
                        colorspace -> using 'proofRenderingIntent' -> output
                        colorspace

                        Added LCMS FLAGS support.
                        Added FLAGS["SOFTPROOFING"] as default flag for
                        buildProofTransform (otherwise the proof Profile/intent
                        would be ignored).

        0.1.0 pil       March 2009 - added to PIL, as PIL.ImageCms

        0.0.2 alpha     Jan 6, 2002

                        Added try/except statements around type() checks of
                        potential CObjects... Python won't let you use type()
                        on them, and raises a TypeError (stupid, if you ask
                        me!)

                        Added buildProofTransformFromOpenProfiles() function.
                        Additional fixes in DLL, see DLL code for details.

        0.0.1 alpha     first public release, Dec. 26, 2002

    Known to-do list with current version (of Python interface, not pyCMSdll):

    Building the transform is a fair part of the overhead in
    ImageCms.ProfileToProfile(), so if you're planning on converting multiple
    images using the same input/output settings, this can save you time.
    Once you have a transform object, it can be used with
    ImageCms.applyProfile() to convert images without the need to re-compute
    the lookup table for the transform.

    The reason pyCMS returns a class object rather than a handle directly
    to the transform is that it needs to keep track of the PIL input/output
    modes that the transform is meant for.  These attributes are stored in
    the ``inMode`` and ``outMode`` attributes of the object (which can be
    manually overridden if you really want to, but I don't know of any
    time that would be of use, or would even work).

    Usage of the resulting transform object is exactly the same as with
    ImageCms.buildTransform().

    Proof Profileing is generally used when using an output device to get a
    good idea of what the final printed/displayed image would look like on
    the ``proofProfile`` device when it's quicker and easier to use the
    output device for judging color.  Generally, this means that the
    output device is a monitor, or a dye-sub printer (etc.), and the simulated
    device is something more expensive, complicated, or time consuming
    (making it difficult to make a real print for color judgement purposes).

    Soft-proofing basically functions by adjusting the colors on the
    output device to match the colors of the device being simulated. However,
    when the simulated device has a much wider gamut than the output
    device, you may obtain marginal results.
